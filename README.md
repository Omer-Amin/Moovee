# Moovee
Moovee is a powerful and lightweight 2D animation library. It enables you to form complex animations using basic descriptors and utilises an events-based system to allow you to fine tune each individual component of each animation frame in real time.

Moovee is ideal for incorporating animations into games where general behaviour needs to be fine tuned by unpredictable variables. An example is smooth camera panning to points changing in real time.
