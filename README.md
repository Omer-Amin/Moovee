# Moovee
Moovee is a powerful and lightweight 2D animation library. It enables you to form complex animations using basic descriptors and utilises an events-based system to allow you to fine tune each individual component of each animation frame in real time.

Moovee is ideal for incorporating animations into games where behaviour is desired but values cannot be pre-determined. An example is smooth camera panning in real time.
