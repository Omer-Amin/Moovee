# Moovee
Moovee is a powerful and lightweight 2D animation library. It utilises an events-based system to allow for real-time interactibility and tuning of individual frames.

Moovee is fundamentally a library for incrementally chaging values in desired ways using calculus and interpolation. It does the heavylifting for you and provides a framework for access and manipulation at each increment. As such, its applications are infinite.

Example uses for Moovee:
* Timed animations for YouTube (think 3Blue1Brown)
* Implementing smooth panning/zoom effects in games
* Interactable math demonstrations
* Screen saver animations
